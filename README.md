This work was carried out by an extra project opportunity for my Cosmology course at my master's studies in Physics.

In this work I examined how the Friedmann equations change by generalizing the metric tensor by introducing a time-dependent lapse function "L" for the 00-th component and also making the curvature k time-dependent. See the calculations needed in the attached Wolfram Mathematica file and the project in the pdf one.
